## My personal system configuration

This is my personal Arch Linux setup. This config is simple and doesn't have any fancy setup. All config settings are set by/for myself.

If it will be opened some day I don't recommend to use it as it is. Netherless use it for inspiration.

To install, place files from this repo inside $HOME directory, and run setup.sh.
It's not full or and may be update later. Even exist parts don't set properly.
